// todo-protocol — customizes the todowrite tool description (flush/deque protocol)
// and strips the shipped serial-todo bullets from the assembled system prompt.
// No imports on purpose: this file is loaded standalone and must never fail to
// resolve modules; hooks are pure string/field mutations.

const TODOWRITE_DESCRIPTION = `Maintain the session todo list. Every call writes the complete list as one atomic snapshot — the transaction is the harness's; the protocol is what a flush means.

Flush protocol:
- Construct the new list, then flush it in one call. Batch status changes at natural boundaries instead of micro-flushing.
- Each item's content starts with its slug (item00, item01, …; Dewey-decimal insertion files new items between existing ones, e.g. item05.5). The slug is the item's permanent id. Never renumber. Array position is just current order.
- Deque semantics, expressed as the snapshot you flush:
  - New user tasks default to the bottom. Only place elsewhere when the user says do it next / push it.
  - Follow-on work found while completing an item is appended as new items at the bottom — never folded into the old item by editing it.
  - Never rewrite or reorder existing rows to absorb new information. A discovered "do not do X" that applies to remaining work is appended as a footer item at the bottom — done items don't care; future items need fast footers.
- The fat record for an item is its living document — itemNN.md in the plan or the project's gitignored scratch directory — subject to amendment. Read an item's living doc before working it; amend the living doc, not the todo row. The living docs and the stored list survive compaction; if the list state is uncertain, re-derive it from the living docs, then flush.
- Status: pending | in_progress | completed | cancelled. Mark completed on the first non-crashed attempt; follow-on work becomes a new item rather than holding the old one open. Several items may be in_progress at once when work is genuinely parallel (one per running subagent) — never fewer than one while work remains, never stale ones. cancelled keeps the record instead of deleting it.
- Priority: high | medium | low.
- Single writer: only the orchestrator flushes. Subagents report back; the orchestrator updates the list.`
